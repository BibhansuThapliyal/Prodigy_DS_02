# Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset

## Objective

This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset sourced from Kaggle. The objective is to derive meaningful insights from the data and understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival.

## Goals

1. Explore the relationships between various features such as age, sex, class, and fare.
2. Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.
3. Identify patterns, trends, and correlations through visualizations and statistical analysis.
4. Gain insights into the survival distribution across different demographic and socio-economic groups.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Format**: CSV

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** – for general-purpose programming and analysis
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** – for static data visualization
- **Seaborn** – for advanced statistical data visualization

## Key Steps

- Data loading and initial inspection
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Correlation heatmaps
- Survival rate analysis based on:
  - Gender
  - Age groups
  - Passenger class
  - Embarkation port
  - Family size

## Outcome

This analysis helps build an intuitive understanding of how different features influenced the likelihood of survival. These insights can later assist in building predictive models.
